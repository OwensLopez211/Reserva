# Testing Public Booking - Quick Setup Guide

## Issue Found
The error is occurring because you're testing with organization slug `"asdasd"` which doesn't exist in the database.

## Quick Fix

### 1. First, populate test organizations in your database:

```bash
cd reservaplus_backend
python manage.py populate_marketplace  # Creates 4 organizations with full test data
```

### 2. Use valid organization slugs for testing:

Instead of testing with:
```
POST /public/booking/org/asdasd/book/
```

Use one of these valid slugs:
```
POST /public/booking/org/salon-bella-vista/book/
POST /public/booking/org/clinica-dental-smilecenter/book/
POST /public/booking/org/fitlife-personal-training/book/
POST /public/booking/org/spa-relax-wellness/book/
```

### 3. Test Data Available

After running `populate_marketplace`, you'll have:

**Salon Bella Vista** (`salon-bella-vista`)
- 2 professionals: Ana Garc√≠a, Carlos Ruiz
- 3 services: Corte de Cabello, Coloraci√≥n, Tratamiento Capilar
